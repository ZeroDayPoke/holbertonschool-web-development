## Overview

The Smileschool Advanced CSS project focuses on styling the previously constructed HTML structure. The styles are inspired by a design file from Figma, ensuring the web page looks as close to the design as possible.

## File Architecture

The project has the following File Architecture:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
â””â”€â”€ images/
    â”œâ”€â”€ background.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ banner-button.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ footer-logo.png
```

- `index.html`: The main HTML file from the prior project.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the HTML structure, which is the goal of the current project.
- `images/`: Directory containing image exports from the Figma design file.


## Structure

The CSS is structured to style the following sections:

- **Header & Banner**: Styling for the main navigation and welcoming banner.
- **Quotes**: Styling for the testimonial section.
- **Videos**: Styling for the popular tutorials showcase.
- **Membership**: Styling for the benefits of free membership.
- **FAQ**: Styling for the frequently asked questions.
- **Footer**: Styling for the footer section with social media links.
