## Overview

The projects are based on a design file from Figma, ensuring the web pages look as close to the design as possible.

## Projects

- **HTML Advanced**: Located in the `html_advanced/` directory, this project focuses on constructing a skeletal HTML structure based on the design file.
  
- **CSS Advanced**: Located in the `css_advanced/` directory, this project is a continuation of the HTML Advanced project. The goal is to style the skeletal HTML structure using CSS.

In addition to the above directories, this repository also contains copies of the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `images/` from which the GitHub Pages live demo is built and hosted.

## Live Demo
